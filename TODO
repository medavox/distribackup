implement receiving serialised file
create own serialisation format
	type-length-value, bencode, MessagePack
	list ALL possible message types, then derive needed data types
UUID and peerinfo sending

callback to send file
publisher maintain list of subscribers
make exception catching consistent: have a consistent policy
redo package structure

short term:

0. Finish primitive dataype binary conversion methods as needed

1. Implement compound type binary conversion methods (to and from)
    * FileInfo	DONE (still needs other binary methods implementing)
    * DirInfo
    * FileData	
    * PeerInfo
    * Address
    * List
    * HList


2. Write the actual methods which do the transferring
write the action of the doing of transferring; likely lots of consecutive actions/boilerplate
