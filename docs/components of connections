MAX_INCOMING_CONNECTIONS
MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS
pipe
	peer
		ip address, port
listener
a queue for downloads when no connection ports are free

min block size (256KB)
mediocre domestic internet upload speed is still 1Mbps (128KB/s)
so use that as a baseline for minimum useful chunk size

max block size is 16MB
a reasonable amount of data to have in memory at once, especially for RasPis

Types of Message extension

file block
	file name/path
	index/offset from filestart
	checksum?
	length?
	payload:byte[]
	revision number:int/long
	
filesend
version info
upgrade or gtfo

'haveblock' advertisements to fellow subscribed mirrors
block requests to other peers (broadcast to all known peers)

request for peers (broadcast)
peer list
some kind of consistency check with the publisher (checksum/length check over all files?)
checksum request
checksum data (per-file or whole tree)
filesystem state
#version/revision numbers for each block or update

Make sure to use a raised value for the connection backlog on the listener socket.
This will allow more connections to be queued up before the OS returns "Connection refused",
should your server application become momentarily busy and unable to respond to incoming connections quickly enough.

If using ServerSocket in Java, specify the desired backlog as an argument to the constructor:

ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(listenPort, 50);
