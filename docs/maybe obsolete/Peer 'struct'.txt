peers usually have open sockets, but they won't when they leave
but we still need to store iformation about them like last seen, bandwidth, local copy state...

peerINFO
	UUID
	host:string/ip
	port:int
	isUp:boolean (if we can't connect, can others in the network?)
	socket:Socket(null if isUp == false)
	upSpeed:int(KB/s)
	downSpeed:int(KB/s)
		how do we measure these?
	local filesystem state (info may be stale)
	lastSeen:Date-time
	version:int
