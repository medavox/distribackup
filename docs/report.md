#Introduction

Start with a brief statement of the overall aim of the project. Give an overview of the problem being addressed by the project. Describe aspects of the background such as why the project is worth doing, how the project may be useful or helpful for others. Then state the aims of the project (preferably as bullet points). End the chapter with a brief chapter by chapter overview of the rest of the report

#Background

Analysis of background research and reading. Summarise technical problems and approaches. Discuss any relevant work and/or existing related systems. For related work and systems also discuss their implications for your project. For example, any improvements that your system offers, shortcomings that your work addresses, and so on. Justify your choice of platform, software, solution etc. Care should be taken not to stray too much into design and implementation details, which belong in later chapters. 

#Design

Major design decisions and justifications. System architecture, etc. Use supporting figures where appropriate and helpful. A diagram of the overall architecture is essential. Each component in the architectural diagram should be briefly discussed. Other designs that may be important are class hierarchies and initial user interface designs. Take care to describe any design work in reasonably high level terms, and do not stray into implementation details. Make sure that you explain to the reader how to interpret any design notation that you use (e.g. a key in the relevant figures), unless you are using a standard notation (such as UML).

#Implementation

Overview of implementation, main data structures. Really important implemented algorithms may be included (maybe in the form of pseudocode), but do not include actual code, except for very small portions of code that represent a solution to a particularly interesting or difficult problem (even then, pseudocode is better). Again, use figures as appropriate, e.g., to support discussion of communication between main procedures/methods in terms of procedure/method name, parameters, result type, function, relationship to other procedures/methods and so on.

#The system in operation/Process description

###(Note: possibly two chapters):

Give the reader a feel for what the system is like to use (this may only be really relevant if the system has a user interface). Use screen dumps to illustrate - textually quite a short chapter, maybe just a walkthrough of the main features of a typical session with the system. Note that this is not a user manual. You aren't showing the reader how to operate the system, but rather what it’s like to use. As a separate chapter, you may also need a process description of your system, so that the reader can appreciate how the system works. This is not the same as the “walkthrough” described immediately above. It should be a description at a higher level than the code itself. Use supporting process diagrams as appropriate If your system has a significant user interface and a complex underlying system you may need both a walkthrough and a process chapter.

#Testing & Evaluation

How you evaluated the system, how you designed the evaluation. Results of the evaluation. A critical review of the evaluation itself: how well it yielded the info you wanted. There may be a need to have two chapters, one on testing and one on evaluation. Testing is intended to establish that the system functions correctly. Evaluation examines how well the system achieves its aim. For a system that features a user interface, some kind of user interface evaluation is very important. For testing and evaluation, you must include descriptions of the methodology and metrics used. Tables of results may be included (main results can be summarised if a large amount of test data was accumulated). Make sure you discuss interesting and important results indicated by the data. Make sure you summarise your overall findings, including statistical evaluation, and describing methods.

#Conclusions

VERY important chapter. Revisit your objectives from chapter 1, for each, analyse whether the project met that objective, and if not, discuss this, and suggest a solution. Discuss the project as a whole, if you did it again would you do it differently? What did you have to learn to do the project, what did you learn from doing it? What features would you add to your system if you had more time etc? Some suggested subsections for your concluding chapter are: Review of aims; Suggested revisions to design/implementation; Future work (possible developments of existing system); Lessons learned. Finish the concluding chapter with a brief, fairly upbeat overall conclusion on the project as a whole. Even projects that are not an overall success usually achieve something, and you acquire skills and knowledge from doing the project. End on a positive note.
