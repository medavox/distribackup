research:
UPnP and how you add port forwarding rules - also NAT traversal
2 big challenges will be 1) finding other nodes, 2) gaining connection access
DHT - how to extract useful information from the distributed hash table, and which impl is best for me
DHT isn't a codebase - it's an actually running global network
    use well-known nodes to store information in the network using hash table - multiple hash hops
    retrieval is consequentially slow

Rsync algorithm
    1. Receiver sends list of local files and checksums of blocks of each file
    2. For every file in Sender's filetree, identical blocks are looked for sing rolling checksum
        stronger checksums are used at some point to double-check identicality
    3. Sender sends missing/new data, plus refs to common blocks, and how to reassemble all this into the new file
        missing files are sent verbatim
