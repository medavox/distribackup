research:
UPnP and how you add port forwarding rules - also NAT traversal
2 big challenges will be 1) finding other nodes, 2) gaining connection access
DHT - how to extract useful information from the distributed hash table, and which impl is best for me
	namely, how to find devices who are on our overlay network (this has already been solved by cleverer people than me)
Rsync algorithm - how it calculates which chunks to send - it uses chunks right?
	Sliding window blah blah?
bit-torrent piece trading algorithm
