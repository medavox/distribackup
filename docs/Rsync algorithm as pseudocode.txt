Rsync algorithm as pseudocode

On The Sender (with the latest version)
For each file id the generator sends,
	it will store the block checksums
	and build a hash index of them for rapid lookup.

Then the local file is read,
and a checksum is generated for the block beginning with the first byte of the local file.
This block checksum is looked for in the set that was sent by the generator.
	if no match is found (there's no block on receiver with this checksum),
		the non-matching byte will be appended to the non-matching data 
		and the block starting at the next byte will be compared.
(This is what is referred to as the “rolling checksum”)
	else if a block checksum match is found,
		it is considered a matching block
		and any accumulated non-matching data will be sent to the receiver followed by the offset and length in the receiver's file of the matching block,
		and the block checksum generator will be advanced to the next byte after the matching block.

(Matching blocks can be identified in this way even if the blocks are reordered or at different offsets. This process is the very heart of the rsync algorithm.)
