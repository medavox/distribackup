split evaluation and testing sections
write in more academic style
embed tables as PNGs in LaTeX to ensure they work
check spelling
do evaluation
put the lifecycle stuff in another section, specified by barry's feedback
focus more on what you have than what you wanted,
 with small afterthought-like notes on how this compares to the original design
    don't jump back and forth between 'fantasy' and 'reality'
convert nearly all bullet pointed lists into descriptive paragraphs
